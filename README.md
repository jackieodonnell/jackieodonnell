## Hello world. 👋 Welcome to my corner of the web!
<img align="center" width="100%" src="banner.png"/>


I'm a full-stack developer with a knack for finding and solving problems. When I'm not pushing commits, you'll often catch me setting up spikes on the volleyball court, building extravagant mansions in The Sims, or walking down the beach with my dog. 🐶


### Find me on social media:
Just kidding, I'm off-the-grid! But you can add me on LinkedIn...
